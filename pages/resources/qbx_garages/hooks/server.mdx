# Server Hooks

## RegisterHook

Registers a hook that allows you to intercept or modify behavior before and after specific events in the garage system. The following events can be hooked into:
- `parkVehicle`: Triggered when a vehicle is parked.
- `spawnVehicle`: Triggered when a vehicle is spawned.
- `spawnedVehicle`: Triggered after a vehicle has been spawned.

Hooks should return `true` to proceed with the action, or `false` to cancel the action. Additionally, hooks can modify some aspects of the action, depending on the payload.

```lua
exports.qbx_garages:registerHook(eventName, callbackFunction)
```

### Parameters

- **eventName**: The name of the event to hook into. Available event names:
  - `parkVehicle`
  - `spawnVehicle`
  - `spawnedVehicle`
  
- **callbackFunction**: A function that will be called when the event is triggered. The function receives a `payload` table with relevant data for the event. The callback should return `true` to allow the action, or `false` to cancel the action.

## Payload Structure

Each hook provides a `payload` object that contains useful data related to the event. Here's the structure for each event:

### `parkVehicle` Payload

```lua
{
    source = number,         -- The player source ID
    netId = number,          -- The network ID of the vehicle
    props = table,           -- Vehicle properties (ox_lib format)
    garageName = string,     -- The name of the garage where the vehicle is parked
    vehicleId = number,      -- The vehicle's unique ID
    owned = boolean,         -- Whether the player owns the vehicle
    vehicle = entity         -- The vehicle entity itself
}
```

### `spawnVehicle` Payload

```lua
{
    source = number,             -- The player source ID
    vehicleId = number,          -- The vehicle's unique ID
    garage = table,              -- Garage details
    garageName = string,         -- The name of the garage
    accessPointIndex = number,   -- The index of the access point in the garage
    garageType = string,         -- The type of garage (e.g., "normal", "depot")
    spawnCoords = vector3,       -- The coordinates where the vehicle will spawn
    distanceCheck = number,      -- The distance check for nearby vehicles
    doorsLocked = boolean,       -- Whether the vehicle's doors should be locked
    warpPed = boolean,           -- Whether the player should be warped into the vehicle
    vehiclekeys = boolean,       -- Whether the player should be given keys to the vehicle
    playerVehicle = table        -- The player's vehicle data (ox_lib format)
}
```

### `spawnedVehicle` Payload

```lua
{
    source = number,             -- The player source ID
    vehicleId = number,          -- The vehicle's unique ID
    garage = table,              -- Garage details
    garageName = string,         -- The name of the garage
    accessPointIndex = number,   -- The index of the access point in the garage
    garageType = string,         -- The type of garage (e.g., "normal", "depot")
    spawnCoords = vector3,       -- The coordinates where the vehicle was spawned
    distanceCheck = number,      -- The distance check for nearby vehicles
    doorsLocked = boolean,       -- Whether the vehicle's doors are locked
    warpPed = boolean,           -- Whether the player was warped into the vehicle
    vehiclekeys = boolean,       -- Whether the player has keys to the vehicle
    playerVehicle = table,       -- The player's vehicle data (ox_lib format)
    veh = entity,                -- The vehicle entity itself
    netId = number               -- The network ID of the spawned vehicle
}
```

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Basic Hook Implementation

```lua
local hook = {}

CreateThread(function()
    -- Hook to handle vehicle parking
    hook.parkVehicleHook = exports.qbx_garages:registerHook('parkVehicle', function(payload)
        local hasKey = exports['Renewed-Vehiclekeys']:hasKey(payload.source, payload.props.plate)
        if hasKey then
            exports['Renewed-Vehiclekeys']:removeKey(payload.source, payload.props.plate)
            exports.qbx_core:Notify(payload.source, 'The keys for the vehicle with plate '..payload.props.plate..' have been removed.', 'inform')
        end
        return true
    end)

    -- Hook to handle vehicle spawning
    hook.spawnVehicleHook = exports.qbx_garages:registerHook('spawnVehicle', function(payload)
        -- Check if the player has the key before spawning the vehicle
        local hasKey = exports['Renewed-Vehiclekeys']:hasKey(payload.source, payload.playerVehicle.props.plate)
        if not hasKey then
            exports['Renewed-Vehiclekeys']:addKey(payload.source, payload.playerVehicle.props.plate)
            exports.qbx_core:Notify(payload.source, 'The keys for the vehicle with plate '..payload.playerVehicle.props.plate..' have been given to you.', 'inform')
        end
        return true
    end)

    -- Hook to handle events after vehicle spawning
    hook.spawnedVehicleHook = exports.qbx_garages:registerHook('spawnedVehicle', function(payload)
        if payload.veh and payload.netId then
            -- Lock the vehicle after spawning
            Entity(payload.veh).state:set('vehicleLock', {lock = 2, sound = true}, true)
            exports.qbx_core:Notify(payload.source, 'Safe travels.', 'inform')
        end
        return true
    end)
end)

lib.print.debug(json.encode(hook))
```

---

### Example 2: Hook Returning `false` to Cancel an Action

In this example, the hook checks if the player has enough money to park the vehicle. If they don't, the action is canceled.

```lua
local hook = {}

CreateThread(function()
    -- Hook to handle vehicle parking
    hook.parkVehicleHook = exports.qbx_garages:registerHook('parkVehicle', function(payload)
        -- Check if the player has enough money to park the vehicle
        local playerMoney = exports.ox_inventory:GetItem(payload.source, 'money', nil, true)
        local requiredAmount = 500 -- example amount required to park
        
        if playerMoney < requiredAmount then
            exports.qbx_core:Notify(payload.source, 'You don\'t have enough money to park this vehicle.', 'error')
            return false -- Cancel the parking action
        else
            exports.ox_inventory:RemoveItem(payload.source, 'money', requiredAmount)
        end
        
        return true -- Proceed with parking if the player has enough money
    end)
end)

lib.print.debug(json.encode(hook))
```

## RemoveHooks

Removes previously registered hooks.

```lua
exports.qbx_garages:removeHooks(hookId)
```

### Parameters

- **hookId**: The ID of the hook that was returned when registering it.

---

### Example

```lua
local hookId = exports.qbx_garages:registerHook('parkVehicle', function(payload)
    -- Hook logic here
end)

-- Later, remove the hook
exports.qbx_garages:removeHooks(hookId)
```
